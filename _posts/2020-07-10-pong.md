Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

My first assignment was Pong. Here I recreated the classic Pong game and implemented an AI paddle to play against! Neato!
